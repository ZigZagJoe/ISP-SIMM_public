# ISP-SIMM V2 Production Files
These are gerbers and production files to have the ISP-SIMM V2 PCB built at JLCPCB. I am not happy with this board design - It's one of the earlier ones I've done - but it does work.
As I don't intend to build more ISP-SIMMs I present these files so you can build your own. 

Note: This design is posted for NON-COMMERCIAL use only. There is no warranty expressed or implied, you're on your own!
